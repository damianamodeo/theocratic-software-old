  // Place your Latest workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
  // description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
  // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
  // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
  // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "-Map Function": {
    "prefix": "function",
    "body": [

      "{${1:${CLIPBOARD}}.map((${2:${CLIPBOARD}}: any, index: number) => {",
      "   //console.log('${TM_FILENAME_BASE}', `${'${2:${CLIPBOARD}}'}`)",
      "  return <div key={${2:${CLIPBOARD}}.id}>",
      "    {${2:${CLIPBOARD}}.$3}",
      "  </div>;",
      "})}",
